description: Lume â€“ A static site generator for Deno
---

**Lume** is the Galician word for *fire*
but also a (yet another) static site generator for [Deno](https://deno.land/).

Itâ€™s inspired by other general-purpose static site generators,
such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/),
but itâ€™s faster, simpler and easier to use and configure,
besides being super flexible.

- Supports **multiple file formats**,
  like Markdown, YAML, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX and Nunjucks,
  and itâ€™s easy to extend.
- You can hook **processors** to manipulate HTML and assets,
  like `css` or `js`.
- Itâ€™s Deno: Forget about managing thousands of packages in `node_modules`
  or complex bundlers. Lume only installs what you need. Clean, fast and secure.
